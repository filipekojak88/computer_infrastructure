    "### Create Directory Structure (Task 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Task description: Using the command line, create a directory (that is, a folder) named `data` at the root of your repository. Inside `data`, create two subdirectories: timestamps and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the directory structure, the following process was carried out using terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verifying the Current Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The process began by ensuring the current working directory was the root of the repository, `computer_infrastructure`.  \n",
    "    This was confirmed by examining the terminal prompt `-> computer_infrastructure git:(main)` and listing the contents using the `ls` command, which showed only the `README.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Researching Commands for Directory Creation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Research was conducted to identify the appropriate command for creating directories.  \n",
    "    An online tutorial from the Simple Dev website provided information on using the `mkdir` command to create folders [1](1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating the Main Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The main directory, `data`, was created in the root of the repository using the command:  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mkdir data\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The `ls` command was used again to verify that the `data` directory had been successfully created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Creating Subdirectories:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    To create the subdirectories `timestamps` and `weather` within `data`, the `mkdir` command with the `-p` option was used. \n",
    "    This option allows nested directory creation.  \n",
    "    The command executed was:  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mkdir -p data/timestamps data/weather  \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This created both subdirectories simultaneously under the `data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Correcting Subdirectory Name:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    During verification, it was observed that one of the subdirectories was mistakenly named `timestamp` instead of `timestamps`.   \n",
    "    To address this, the `mv` command was used for renaming. After reviewing the `mv` manual, using the `man mv` command, the correct syntax was determined and executed as follows: \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mv data/timestamp data/timestamps.  \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This renamed the subdirectory to the correct name."

Make sure to use the  >> operator to append (not overwrite) the file. Repeat this step ten times, then use the more command to verify that now.txt has the expected content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe the approach in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the Target Directory: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The directory `data/timestamps` was accessed from the root of the repository `computer_infrastructure` using the cd command [2](2): \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd data/timestamps\n",
    "    ```    \n",
    "2. Append Date and Time to the File:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Research and class materials provided insights on formatting and appending date-time entries to a file. The date command with the `>>` operator was used to append the current date and time to `now.txt`.  \n",
    "    The command also included a format string to ensure the output followed the `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` pattern: \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\" >> now.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The `>>` operator appends the output to the file without overwriting it [3](3).   \n",
    "    The `+\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\"` format ensures that the timestamp is recorded in a compact and consistent format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Verify File Creation and Content:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The `ls` command was used to list files in the timestamps directory, confirming the creation of `now.txt` [4](4).  \n",
    "    The `cat` command was then used to display the file content for verification [5](5):   \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cat now.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    4. Repeat the Process:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The date appending command was executed nine additional times to add more timestamps to `now.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Verification Using `more`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    To review the content of `now.txt` after all entries were appended, the 'more' command was used:  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    more now.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Unlike `cat`, which displays all content at once, `more` is helpful for viewing larger files in a paginated manner [6](6)."

Refer to the date man page (using man date) for more formatting options. (Press q to exit the man page). Append the formatted output to a file named formatted.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the steps and commands used to complete the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consulting the Manual for the `date` Command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To determine how to format the output of the `date` command, the `man` (manual) page for the command was consulted:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   man date\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This provided the formatting options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Year: `%Y`\n",
    "   - Month: `%m`\n",
    "   - Day: `%d`\n",
    "   - Hour: `%H`\n",
    "   - Minute: `%M`\n",
    "   - Second: `%S`  \n",
    "\n",
    "   It was noted that to display the formatted date, the `+` operand must be used, followed by the desired format enclosed in double quotes. For example:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"\n",
    "   ```   \n",
    "   For additional reference, the documentation at PhoenixNAP was consulted, reinforcing the use of formatting strings and the + operand [7](7). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Running the Formatted `date` Command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To test the formatting, the following command was executed:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"\n",
    "   ```   \n",
    "   This returned the current date and time in the expected format (e.g., `20241020_214025`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigating to the Target Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   As the `formatted.txt` file was to be created in the `data` directory (used previously in Tasks 1 and 2), navigation was required. From the `data/timestamps` directory, the following command moved up one level:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd ../\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   Alternatively, the shorthand `../` was also used directly to indicate moving to the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Appending the Formatted Date to `formatted.txt`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   While in the `data` directory, the following command appended the formatted date and time to the `formatted.txt` file:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The `>>` operator ensured the output was appended to the file without overwriting any existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verifying the File Content:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To confirm the file content, the `cat` command was used:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cat formatted.txt\n",
    "   ```     \n",
    "   This displayed the date and time in the correct format (e.g., `20241020_223520`)."

    "\n",
    "Steps used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Researching the Approach:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   While researching how to create a file with a dynamically generated name, a helpful reference was found on SuperUser [8](8). This outlined how to combine the `touch` command with the `date` command using backticks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The format for embedding the date was:\n",
    "   - Backticks (\\`) to encapsulate the `date` command.\n",
    "   - The `date` command followed by the `+` operand to specify the desired output format.\n",
    "   - Adding `.txt` after the formatted date to ensure the file is created as a text file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constructing the Command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The following command was used to create the file:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt\"`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - touch: Creates a new empty file.  \n",
    "   - \\`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"\\`: Formats the current date and time into the desired `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS` structure.  \n",
    "   - Backticks (\\` \\`): Embed the formatted date output as the file name.  \n",
    "   - .txt: Ensures the file extension is `.txt`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verifying the File Creation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   After executing the command, the `ls` command was run to list the files in the directory.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This confirmed the creation of the file `20241020_225246.txt` (or a similarly formatted name based on the exact time the command was executed).\n"

    "\n",
    "Task Description: Change to the 'data/weather' directory. Download the latest weather data for the Athenry weather station from Met Eireann using 'wget'. Use the `-O <filename>` options to save the file as 'weather.json'. The data can be found at this URL: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today. [10](10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a detailed explanation of the steps taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing `wget` \n",
    "\n",
    "   Initially, the `wget` command was not available on the system. Installation instructions were researched online and a solution was found on Stack Overflow [9](9), which suggested using the Homebrew package manager. To install `wget`, the following command was used in Terminal:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   brew install wget\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After the installation, it was confirmed that `wget` was available by typing `wget --help`, which displayed the list of options and usage instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Understanding `wget` Options \n",
    "\n",
    "   To understand how the `wget` command works, especially the `-O` option, the manual was consulted by typing:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   man wget\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   From the manual and class materials (Week 06, Video 02), it was learned that the `-O` option, also written as `--output-document`, allows users to specify a single output filename for the downloaded content. This option is useful when the original filename from the URL is not descriptive or suitable for the task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigating to the Target Directory \n",
    "\n",
    "   Navigated to the `data/weather` directory by running:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd data/weather\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This ensured the downloaded file would be stored in the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Downloading the Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using the `wget` command with the `-O` option, the data was downloaded from the specified URL and saved it as `weather.json`. The command used was:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   wget -O weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   This successfully downloaded the weather data and saved it under the name `weather.json` in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verifying the Download\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the download, the presence of `weather.json` was confirmed by listing the contents of the directory using the `ls` command.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The output showed that `weather.json` was successfully created.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Viewing the File Content  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To inspect the contents of the file, the `nano` text editor was used:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   nano weather.json\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   This allowed the verification that the file contained the expected weather data in JSON format.\n"

    "\n",
    "Task Description: Modify the command from Task 5 to save the downloaded file with a timestamped name in the format YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.json.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete Task 6, the approach built upon the knowledge gained from Tasks 4 and 5. Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The command was structured as follows:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    wget -O \\`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"\\` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Here’s a breakdown of the command:  \n",
    "    - `wget`: Used to download the weather data from the specified URL.  \n",
    "    - `-O`: Specifies the output file name.  \n",
    "    - \\`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"\\`: Generates the timestamped file name:   \n",
    "        - using the current date and time in the desired format.   \n",
    "        - appending `.json` to indicate the file type.   \n",
    "        - The backticks (\\`) embed the output of the `date` command directly into the `wget` command, dynamically naming the file.    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. After running the command in the Terminal, the file was successfully saved in the current directory with the timestamped name, such as `20241124_153025.json`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. To confirm that the file contained the expected weather data, the `nano` command was used to open and verify its content, ensuring it was in the correct JSON format and included the weather data as expected."

    "\n",
    "Here's the rewritten report in third person:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating the Script File\n",
    "\n",
    "   The process began with the creation of an empty file named `weather.sh` in the `weather` directory using the `touch` command:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch weather.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The script file was then moved to the root directory of the repository (`computer_infrastructure`) to ensure accessibility. This was achieved using the `mv` command:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mv weather.sh ../../\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   Apple’s Terminal guide on moving files between directories was referenced for this step [11](11).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding the Script Content\n",
    "\n",
    "   The file `weather.sh` was opened in Visual Studio Code, and a \"shebang\" (`#!/bin/bash`) was added as the first line to indicate that the script should be executed using the bash shell. This ensures the system interprets the script correctly [12](12).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The second line contained the command used in Task 6 to download the weather data and save it with a timestamped filename in the `data/weather` directory:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   wget -O data/weather/`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   Care was taken to ensure there were no spaces between `data/weather/` and the `date` command, as such spaces could result in filename errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Making the Script Executable\n",
    "\n",
    "   The permissions of `weather.sh` were checked in the root the main repository `computer_infrastructure` using:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls -al\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   It was observed that the file lacked execute permissions, which are required to run the script. The permissions were updated using the `chmod` command:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod u+x weather.sh\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   Re-running `ls -al` confirmed the change, with the `x` permission now visible and the file name displayed in a distinct color, indicating its executable status [13](13).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testing the Script  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The script was tested by executing it from the root directory:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ./weather.sh\n",
    "   ``` \n",
    "   An initial error occurred:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   data/weather/: Is a directory\n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   Troubleshooting with Chat GPT revealed that the error was caused by an unintended space between `data/weather/` and the `date` command in the script [14](14):\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Before Change: \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   wget -O data/weather/ `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - After Change: \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   wget -O data/weather/`date+ \"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The space was removed, and the script was executed again. This successfully created a file with a timestamped name (e.g., `20241028_163417.json`) in the `data/weather` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verifying the Output\n",
    "\n",
