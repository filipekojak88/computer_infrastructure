    "## Task 1: Create Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Task description: Using the command line, create a directory (that is, a folder) named `data` at the root of your repository. Inside `data`, create two subdirectories: timestamps and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the directory structure, the following process was carried out using terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verifying the Current Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The process began by ensuring the current working directory was the root of the repository, `computer_infrastructure`.  \n",
    "    This was confirmed by examining the terminal prompt `-> computer_infrastructure git:(main)` and listing the contents using the `ls` command, which showed only the `README.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Researching Commands for Directory Creation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Research was conducted to identify the appropriate command for creating directories.  \n",
    "    An online tutorial from the Simple Dev website provided information on using the `mkdir` command to create folders [1](1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating the Main Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The main directory, `data`, was created in the root of the repository using the command:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    `mkdir data`\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `ls` command was used again to verify that the `data` directory had been successfully created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Creating Subdirectories:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    To create the subdirectories `timestamps` and `weather` within `data`, the `mkdir` command with the `-p` option was used. \n",
    "    This option allows nested directory creation.  \n",
    "    The command executed was:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `mkdir -p data/timestamps data/weather`  \n",
    "\n",
    "    This created both subdirectories simultaneously under the `data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Correcting Subdirectory Name:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    During verification, it was observed that one of the subdirectories was mistakenly named `timestamp` instead of `timestamps`.   \n",
    "    To address this, the `mv` command was used for renaming. After reviewing the `mv` manual, using the `man mv` command, the correct syntax was determined and executed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    `mv data/timestamp data/timestamps`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    This renamed the subdirectory to the correct name."

Make sure to use the  >> operator to append (not overwrite) the file. Repeat this step ten times, then use the more command to verify that now.txt has the expected content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe the approach in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the Target Directory: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The directory `data/timestamps` was accessed from the root of the repository `computer_infrastructure` using the cd command [2](2): \n",
    "    \n",
    "    `cd data/timestamps`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Append Date and Time to the File:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Research and class materials provided insights on formatting and appending date-time entries to a file. The date command with the `>>` operator was used to append the current date and time to `now.txt`.  \n",
    "    The command also included a format string to ensure the output followed the `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` pattern: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    `date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\" >> now.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `>>` operator appends the output to the file without overwriting it [3](3).   \n",
    "    The `+\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\"` format ensures that the timestamp is recorded in a compact and consistent format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Verify File Creation and Content:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The `ls` command was used to list files in the timestamps directory, confirming the creation of now.txt [4](4).  \n",
    "    The `cat` command was then used to display the file content for verification [5](5):   \n",
    "     \n",
    "    `cat now.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Repeat the Process:   \n",
    "\n",
    "    The date appending command was executed nine additional times to add more timestamps to `now.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Verification Using `more`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    To review the content of `now.txt` after all entries were appended, the 'more' command was used:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `more now.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike `cat`, which displays all content at once, `more` is helpful for viewing larger files in a paginated manner [6](6)."

Refer to the date man page (using man date) for more formatting options. (Press q to exit the man page). Append the formatted output to a file named formatted.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the steps and commands used to complete the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consulting the Manual for the `date` Command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To determine how to format the output of the `date` command, the `man` (manual) page for the command was consulted:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `man date`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This provided the formatting options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Year: `%Y`\n",
    "   - Month: `%m`\n",
    "   - Day: `%d`\n",
    "   - Hour: `%H`\n",
    "   - Minute: `%M`\n",
    "   - Second: `%S`  \n",
    "\n",
    "   It was noted that to display the formatted date, the `+` operand must be used, followed by the desired format enclosed in double quotes. For example:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For additional reference, the documentation at PhoenixNAP was consulted, reinforcing the use of formatting strings and the + operand [7](7). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Running the Formatted `date` Command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To test the formatting, the following command was executed:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This returned the current date and time in the expected format (e.g., `20241020_214025`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigating to the Target Directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   As the `formatted.txt` file was to be created in the `data` directory (used previously in Tasks 1 and 2), navigation was required. From the `data/timestamps` directory, the following command moved up one level:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `cd ../`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Alternatively, the shorthand `../` was also used directly to indicate moving to the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Appending the Formatted Date to `formatted.txt`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   While in the `data` directory, the following command appended the formatted date and time to the `formatted.txt` file:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The `>>` operator ensured the output was appended to the file without overwriting any existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verifying the File Content:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To confirm the file content, the `cat` command was used:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `cat formatted.txt`\n",
    "     \n",
    "   This displayed the date and time in the correct format (e.g., `20241020_223520`)."

    "Steps used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Researching the Approach:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   While researching how to create a file with a dynamically generated name, a helpful reference was found on SuperUser [8](8). This outlined how to combine the `touch` command with the `date` command using backticks.  \n",

    "   - Backticks (`) to encapsulate the `date` command.\n",
    "   - The `date` command followed by the `+` operand to specify the desired output format.\n",
    "   - Adding `.txt` after the formatted date to ensure the file is created as a text file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constructing the Command:  \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Installing `wget` \n",
    "\n",
    "   Initially, the `wget` command was not available on the system. Installation instructions were researched online and a solution was found on Stack Overflow [9](9), which suggested using the Homebrew package manager. To install `wget`, the following command was used in Terminal:  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Understanding `wget` Options \n",
    "\n",
    "   To understand how the `wget` command works, especially the `-O` option, the manual was consulted by typing:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `man wget`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   From the manual and class materials (Week 06, Video 02), it was learned that the `-O` option, also written as `--output-document`, allows users to specify a single output filename for the downloaded content. This option is useful when the original filename from the URL is not descriptive or suitable for the task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigating to the Target Directory \n",
    "\n",
    "   Navigated to the `data/weather` directory by running:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `cd data/weather`\n",

    "    \n",
    "   This successfully downloaded the weather data and saved it under the name `weather.json` in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verifying the Download\n",
