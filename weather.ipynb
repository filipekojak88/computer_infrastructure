    "## Task 1: Create Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Task description: Using the command line, create a directory (that is, a folder) named 'data' at the root of your repository. Inside 'data', create two subdirectories: timestamps and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the directory structure, the following process was carried out using terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verifying the Current Directory:  \n",
    "The process began by ensuring the current working directory was the root of the repository, `computer_infrastructure`.  \n",
    "This was confirmed by examining the terminal prompt (`-> computer_infrastructure git:(main)`) and listing the contents using the `ls` command, which showed only the `README.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Researching Commands for Directory Creation:  \n",
    "Research was conducted to identify the appropriate command for creating directories.  \n",
    "An online tutorial from the Simple Dev website provided information on using the `mkdir` command to create folders [1](1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating the Main Directory:  \n",
    "The main directory, `data`, was created in the root of the repository using the command 'mkdir data'.  \n",
    "The `ls` command was used again to verify that the `data` directory had been successfully created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Creating Subdirectories:  \n",
    "To create the subdirectories `timestamps` and `weather` within `data`, the `mkdir` command with the `-p` option was used. This option allows nested directory creation.  \n",
    "The command was 'mkdir -p data/timestamps data/weather' executed.  \n",
    "This created both subdirectories simultaneously under the `data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Correcting Subdirectory Name:  \n",
    "During verification, it was observed that one of the subdirectories was mistakenly named `timestamp` instead of `timestamps`.   \n",
    "To address this, the `mv` command was used for renaming. After reviewing the `mv` manual, using the `man mv` command, the correct syntax was determined and executed as follows 'mv data/timestamp data/timestamps'.  \n",
    "This renamed the subdirectory to the correct name."

    "\n",
    "2 - Looking into https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43221469/write-current-date-time-to-a-file-using-shell-script, I found that I can just type 'date' followed by:\n",
    "'>' if I want to create the new file, or\n",
    "'>>' if I want to append the new file.\n",
    "In this case as it was appending I used '>>'.\n",

    "4 - Then, I added the file name 'now.txt' to be added to the current repository (/Users/filipecarvalho/Desktop/computer_infrastructure/data/timestamps) and pressed enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - This created the file 'now.txt'. I entered ls in Terminal to see the files within the repository timestamps (https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/ls-command-in-linux/) and found 'now.txt', then I used the command 'cat now.txt' to confirm the data within the file (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-cat-command#:~:text=The%20cat%20(concatenate)%20command%20in,files%2C%20and%20create%20new%20files.).\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - I executed 9 more times the command 'date +\" %Y%m%d%H%M%S\" >> now.txt' in Terminal and then checked again the data within the file 'now.txt', but this time I used the command 'more' to see the data. Note: I found this discussion in Quora explaining the difference between 'cat' and 'more' (https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-cat-more-and-less-in-Linux#:~:text=The%20cat%20command%20displays%20the,scroll%20up%20the%20next%20page)."

    "Run the date command again, but this time format the output using YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS (e.g., 20261114_130003 for 1:00:03 PM on November 14, 2016). Refer to the date man page (using man date) for more formatting options. (Press q to exit the man page). Append the formatted output to a file named formatted.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - I consulted the manual for the command date by typing 'date man' in Terminal and pressing enter. I was able to see from the examples that the date can be formatted to output in Terminal in the following way:\n",
    "- Year: %Y\n",
    "- Month: %m\n",
    "- Day: %d\n",
    "- Hour: %H\n",
    "- Minute: %M\n",
    "- Second: %S\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if I want to write YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS in terminal that would have to be written by using \"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\". Note: Double quotes are used in the example before and after the wished format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - I also found by looking into the manual of command date that the operand '+' sign specifies the format in which the date and time must be displayed.\n",
    "In this case as I want the date to be displayed in a certain format, I had to add the plus before the new format. The command typed was like 'date +\" %Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"'.\n",
    "I ran the date command by typing the following in Terminal 'date +\" %Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"' and pressing enter. This gave the current Date and Time in the format expected, i.e. 20241020_214025.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - I had to go from timestamps repository back one parent folder using '../' instead of 'cd ..', which I learned once I forgot the command 'cd ..' and when I tried it then it just worked well. I am taking that the file 'formatted.txt' is to be created in the directory 'data' once this was created in Task 1 and also used in Task 2, which indicates that in Task 3 the directory should also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Confirmed that I was in the repository 'data', then I typed in Terminal the command 'date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt'. This command created the file 'formatted.txt'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - To confirm the date within the file 'formatted.txt' I used the command 'cat formatted.txt' and I was able to see the date and time '20241020_223520'.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, I also reviewed the information on https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-date-command#:~:text=To%20format%20the%20date%20command's,substituted%20by%20their%20current%20values.&text=To%20see%20all%20formatting%20options,or%20use%20the%20man%20command."

    "I consulted the superuser website (https://superuser.com/questions/982156/quickest-way-to-give-file-name-the-current-date-on-linux) and found that I can use touch to create a file and backticks with the command date followed by space, the operand '+' and the date format and backtick again to be able to embed the date with the determined format as a name of the new file created by the command touch.

However, I wanted to understand a bit more on how the command 'wget' works with '-O' to output the file with the specified name. I got the understand that the -O (--output-document) option in wget is used to specify a single output file where all downloaded content will be written, rather than saving each document to its original filename as specified in the URL.\n",
