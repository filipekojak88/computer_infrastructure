# Computer Infrastructure

This repository presents the tasks and project completed for the module of Computer Infrastructure in ATU with the lecturer Ian McLoughlin. 
In order to complete the tasks and the project it was utilized skills in command-line navigation, file management, and Bash scripting to automate tasks like creating directories, timestamping files, and downloading weather data. The Weather Data Processing Report showcases acquired knowledge with Unix commands such as `mkdir`, `wget`, and `touch`, as well as the use of the `date` command for timestamp generation. It also highlights Python programming skills, particularly with the `pandas` library for reading, inspecting, and analyzing JSON data. The ability to troubleshoot and optimize processes, including debugging scripts and using resources like manual pages, is also evident. Overall, the report reflects a blend of command-line, automation techniques, and data analysis capabilities which reflects the content learned in the module of Computer Infrastructure. 

This README has been written with [Github's documentation on README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) and Wenger's article on [Why having a Readme on your internal project is essential](https://wengerk.medium.com/why-having-a-readme-on-your-internal-project-is-essential-c85cb9dd8e65) in mind [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2).     
MarkDown was used in this README file and was based on [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) [[3]](#3).

## About This Project

In this project an analysis has been completed using the data from Palmer Penguins dataset.

The Palmer Penguins dataset is like a treasure trove of information about penguins living near Antarctica. It helps scientists understand how male and female penguins differ in what they eat and how they hunt for food, especially when there's less sea ice around. By studying their diets and body sizes, researchers can figure out why males and females might prefer different hunting spots [3] [4].

This dataset is super handy because it's not just for scientistsâ€”it's also great for teaching and learning about data analysis. It's like replacing an old, not-so-interesting dataset with something way cooler and more relevant. Plus, it's been downloaded tons of times, showing how popular and useful it is for anyone wanting to explore the world of data science [5].

Data was collected near the Palmer Station in Antarctica from penguins:

on three different islands: Dream, Torgersen and Biscoe.

## Use of this project
This project is useful for other users as a source of examples of data analysis that can be completed using Python, and direct them on some conclusions that can be drawn from the data. Perhaps, the perspective adopted in this project can be also adapted by other students to investigate different datasets. Nonetheless, this project reflects the author's understanding and knowledge from the Python programming skills learned so far in this course. Therefore, any contribution or ideas to improve this project will be welcomed.

## Getting Started

1 - Clone this repository...

2 - Run the code...

To get started with this project click on this link 'penguins.ipynb' and navigate through the different sections of this Jupyter from the beginning to the end. But, if you prefer to go to a specific section, then here you can get a quick overview of what is covered:

Loading the Database: This section displays the different imported Python modules used in the analysis of the penguins dataset and the script used to load the data set from the Seaborn's repository in GitHub.
Exploring the Dataset: A quick look into the datase to understand the columns and some of the first and last rows of the dataset.
Types of Variables to Model the Dataset: Here the author checks the types of variables used in the dataset and what type can be used to model it.
Categorical Data and Bar Chart: An analysis is provided grouping two of the categorical variables and the different categories available within those variables, using a bar chart to ilustrate that.
Continuous Numerical Data and Histogram: A summary statistic is perfomed to all continuous numerical variables of the dataset and a deep dive is completed into one of the variables, ending with a histrogram and more details of this analysis.
Correlation between Two Variables from the Dataset: In this section, the author explores how two continuous variables of the dataset correlates to each other. A scatterplot is used and concepts as best fit line and correlation coeficient are applied to support this analysis.
Opportunities for further investigation: Here, the author suggests other areas that users can approach to further analyze the dataset.
Conclusion: A summary and results of the author's analysis and investigation that are carried out on the Palmer Penguins dataset.
